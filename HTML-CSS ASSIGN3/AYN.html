                    <li>Alice O'Connor (born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum;February 2, [O.S. January 20] 1905 – March 6, 1982),
                         better known by her pen name Ayn Rand (/aɪn/),[2] was a Russian-American writer and philosopher.</li>
                    <li>After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel,
                         The Fountainhead.</li>
                    <li>In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. </li>
                    <li>In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral
                         and opposed collectivism, statism, and anarchism.</li>
                    <li>she supported laissez-faire capitalism, which 
                        she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights, including property rights</li>
                    <li>Published in 1957, Atlas Shrugged was considered Rand's magnum opus</li>
                    <li>Rand called her philosophy "Objectivism", describing its essence as 
                        "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, 
                        with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute".</li>
                    <li>Rand died of heart failure on March 6, 1982, in New York City.</li>
